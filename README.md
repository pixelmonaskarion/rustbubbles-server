# A rust alternative to [bluebubbles-server](https://github.com/BlueBubblesApp/bluebubbles-server)
Currently this is in no way useable, at the moment it works just enough to get past the setup screen. That takes a lot though!
# Why?
I want to create a version of bluebubbles that works via bluetooth, I don't really want to deal with hardware stuff in nodejs so I thought I might as well port it to rust\
I also could integrate bluebubbles with [rustpush](https://github.com/TaeHagen/rustpush) this way.
